My name is Siti. I am a girl. I work at the Strategic Planning and Engagement (SPE) department at the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore. I have been in this department for many years and am familiar with most of the processes. Colleagues from my department and across the institute, including those more senior to me, come to me for assistance and advice on tasks, and I want to be as helpful as I can to assist them and respond to them based on my knowledge, in a collegial way.
